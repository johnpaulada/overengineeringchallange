# ðŸ”¥ Over Engineering Challenge

## Rationale ðŸ¤”

Overengineering has always been the pet peeve of many developers. We engineers have this tendency to descend into the chaos of adding nice-to-have features or architecting to support things that might happen in the far future. To avoid this, we create constraints for the project and work around these constraints.

But what if we break out of this for once? What if we do the **OPPOSITE**?

That's where this challenge comes in.

## The Challenge ðŸ’ª

The challenge is to create a **TODO List App** and overengineer it to its limits.

- Make it with the most overkill tech you know.
- Use the most exotic techniques that you can wield.
- Build it with the most overblown architectures.
- Design with the insanest user experience.

**FORK THIS PROJECT** and let your imagination run wild. There are no limits to what you can do.

**JUST OVERENGINEERâ„¢.**

**YOU HAVE THE LICENSE TO DO IT.**

## Example ðŸ“œ
Here's my idea of what I'd do when I do this challenge:

- Create an Elixir GraphQL API using Absinthe
- Create the web application frontend using ReasonReact
- Use Kubernetes to stitch together the web application
- Create a mobile app using Flutter or bs-react-native
